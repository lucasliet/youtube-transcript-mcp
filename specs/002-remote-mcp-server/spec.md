# Feature Specification: Remote MCP Server with SSE Support

**Feature Branch**: `002-remote-mcp-server`  
**Created**: 2025-09-15  
**Status**: Final  
**Input**: User description: "remote mcp server al√©m do uso atual do mcp por stdio, adicionar tamb√©m suporte a remote mcp com sse, possibilitando deploy em um servidor e ser acessado via url a um agente como remote mcp"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a system administrator or developer, I want to deploy the YouTube Transcript MCP server as a remote service accessible via URL, so that multiple MCP clients can connect to it over the network instead of requiring local stdio communication. This enables better scalability, centralized deployment, and easier integration for distributed systems.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the MCP server is deployed remotely, **When** an MCP client connects via URL with SSE support, **Then** the client can successfully request YouTube transcripts and receive responses through the SSE connection
2. **Given** the server is running in remote mode, **When** multiple clients connect simultaneously, **Then** each client receives their requested transcripts independently without interference
3. **Given** the existing stdio mode functionality, **When** users continue to use local stdio mode, **Then** all existing functionality continues to work unchanged
4. **Given** an invalid YouTube URL is sent via remote connection, **When** the server processes the request, **Then** appropriate error messages are returned through the SSE connection

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the SSE connection is interrupted during transcript retrieval?
   R: Nothing
- How does the system handle multiple concurrent requests for the same video? 
   R: As individual requests
- What occurs when the server reaches resource limits with many simultaneous connections? 
   R: Show the error to client
- How are authentication and authorization handled for remote connections? 
   R: No authetication is needed

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST support remote MCP server deployment accessible via URL
- **FR-002**: System MUST implement Server-Sent Events (SSE) for client-server communication
- **FR-003**: System MUST maintain backward compatibility with existing stdio MCP mode
- **FR-004**: Remote server MUST provide the same `transcript_yt` tool functionality as stdio mode
- **FR-005**: System MUST handle multiple concurrent client connections
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide appropriate error handling and response formatting for remote connections
- **FR-007**: System MUST allow configuration between stdio and remote server modes
- **FR-008**: Remote server MUST support the same parameter inputs (videoUrl, preferredLanguages) as stdio mode
- **FR-009**: System MUST handle connection lifecycle management for SSE connections
- **FR-010**: System MUST provide open access with no authentication required
- **FR-011**: System MUST handle concurrent connections

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **SSE Connection**: Represents an active Server-Sent Events connection between client and server, maintaining state for transcript requests and responses
- **Remote MCP Client**: External system or agent that connects to the remote MCP server via URL to request YouTube transcript services
- **Server Configuration**: Settings that determine whether the system runs in stdio mode or remote server mode, including connection parameters and security settings
- **Transcript Request**: Remote request containing YouTube video URL and language preferences, transmitted over SSE connection
- **Error Response**: Structured error information sent back to remote clients when transcript retrieval fails or invalid requests are made
