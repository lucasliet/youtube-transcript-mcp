# Quickstart: Code Quality Improvements

This document provides instructions for validating the code quality improvements.

## Running Tests

To ensure that the refactoring has not changed the existing behavior, run the test suite:

```bash
npm test
```

## Running Code Coverage

A new task will be added to calculate the code coverage of the test suite. To run it, use:

```bash
npm run coverage
```

This command will generate a report indicating the percentage of code that is covered by automated tests.
