# Research: Code Quality Improvements

This document outlines the decisions made to clarify ambiguities in the feature specification for code quality improvements.

## "Nonsense Code" Definition

- **Decision**: "Nonsense code" will be defined as code that is objectively non-functional or redundant.
- **Rationale**: The term "nonsense" is subjective. A concrete definition allows for automated detection and avoids ambiguity.
- **Details**: This includes:
  - Unreachable code blocks.
  - Variables, functions, and classes that are declared but never used.
  - Overly complex or obfuscated logic that can be simplified without changing behavior.

## "Best Practices" Definition

- **Decision**: "Best practices" will be enforced using a standard, popular ESLint configuration.
- **Rationale**: This provides a clear, automated, and industry-accepted standard for code quality. It avoids relying on subjective manual reviews.
- **Details**: A configuration like `eslint-config-airbnb` or `eslint-config-standard` will be used as a baseline. Specific rules may be adjusted to fit the project's needs.
