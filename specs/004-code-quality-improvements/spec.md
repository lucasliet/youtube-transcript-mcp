# Feature Specification: Codebase Review and Refactoring

**Feature Branch**: `004-code-quality-improvements`
**Created**: 2025-09-22
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "review all the repo codebase, search for duplicate code, nonsense code, non used code, and also if it is following best pratices, clean code, single responsability, each file follows its responsability, etc, dont change the project behavior, don't touch the tests, they will be used to assert the current behavior, document non docummented code, remove commented code with // if you find it, also I want to know the current code coverage, it should have a task for int in package.json and github workflow"

---

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer, I want to improve the overall quality of the codebase by identifying and addressing several issues, so that the code is cleaner, more maintainable, and follows best practices.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the current codebase, **When** the review is performed, **Then** a report of duplicate code, nonsense code, and unused code is generated.
2. **Given** the identified issues, **When** the refactoring is applied, **Then** the code adheres to best practices like clean code and single responsibility, without altering the existing behavior.
3. **Given** the codebase, **When** the process is complete, **Then** undocumented code now has documentation.
4. **Given** the codebase, **When** the process is complete, **Then** all `//` comments are removed.
5. **Given** the project, **When** the process is complete, **Then** there is a task in `package.json` to run code coverage analysis.
6. **Given** the project, **When** the process is complete, **Then** there is a GitHub workflow that runs the code coverage task.
7. **Given** the improved codebase, **When** code coverage is measured, **Then** the coverage should be at least 90% for all source files in the `src/` directory.

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-25
- Q: How should "nonsense code" be specifically defined? ‚Üí A: Dead code, unused imports, and redundant conditional statements
- Q: Which ESLint configuration should be used? ‚Üí A: eslint-config-airbnb (strict, opinionated React/JavaScript rules)
- Q: What documentation standard should be applied? ‚Üí A: JSDoc for all functions, classes, and complex logic blocks
- Q: What types of `//` comments should be removed? ‚Üí A: All single-line comments except TODO/FIXME/NOTE
- Q: When should the GitHub workflow execute the code coverage task? ‚Üí A: On push to main and on pull requests (current trigger)

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a file has a mix of used and unused code?
- How to decide if a piece of code is "nonsense"? This includes dead code, unused imports, and redundant conditional statements.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The system MUST scan the entire codebase to identify duplicate code.
- **FR-002**: The system MUST identify code that is not being used.
- **FR-003**: The system MUST identify code that does not follow best practices (clean code, single responsibility), as defined by eslint-config-airbnb configuration.
- **FR-003a**: The system MUST identify "nonsense code" defined as: dead code, unused imports, and redundant conditional statements.
- **FR-004**: The system MUST NOT change the project's behavior, as verified by existing tests.
- **FR-005**: The system MUST add JSDoc documentation to all undocumented functions, classes, and complex logic blocks.
- **FR-006**: The system MUST remove all single-line `//` comments except TODO, FIXME, and NOTE comments.
- **FR-007**: A new script/task named `coverage` MUST be added to `package.json` to calculate code coverage.
- **FR-008**: The existing GitHub workflow MUST be updated to include the code coverage task, triggered on push to main and pull requests to main.
- **FR-009**: The system MUST review existing JSDoc comments and update them if they no longer match the function's behavior.
- **FR-010**: The codebase MUST achieve a minimum of 90% code coverage across all source files in the `src/` directory, measured by line coverage.
