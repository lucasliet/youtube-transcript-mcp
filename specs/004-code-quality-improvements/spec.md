# Feature Specification: Codebase Review and Refactoring

**Feature Branch**: `004-code-quality-improvements`
**Created**: 2025-09-22
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "review all the repo codebase, search for duplicate code, nonsense code, non used code, and also if it is following best pratices, clean code, single responsability, each file follows its responsability, etc, dont change the project behavior, don't touch the tests, they will be used to assert the current behavior, document non docummented code, remove commented code with // if you find it, also I want to know the current code coverage, it should have a task for int in package.json and github workflow"

---

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer, I want to improve the overall quality of the codebase by identifying and addressing several issues, so that the code is cleaner, more maintainable, and follows best practices.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the current codebase, **When** the review is performed, **Then** a report of duplicate code, nonsense code, and unused code is generated.
2. **Given** the identified issues, **When** the refactoring is applied, **Then** the code adheres to best practices like clean code and single responsibility, without altering the existing behavior.
3. **Given** the codebase, **When** the process is complete, **Then** undocumented code now has documentation.
4. **Given** the codebase, **When** the process is complete, **Then** all `//` comments are removed.
5. **Given** the project, **When** the process is complete, **Then** there is a task in `package.json` to run code coverage analysis.
6. **Given** the project, **When** the process is complete, **Then** there is a GitHub workflow that runs the code coverage task.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a file has a mix of used and unused code?
- How to decide if a piece of code is "nonsense"? This will include unreachable code, unused variables/functions, and overly complex logic.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The system MUST scan the entire codebase to identify duplicate code.
- **FR-002**: The system MUST identify code that is not being used.
- **FR-003**: The system MUST identify code that does not follow best practices (clean code, single responsibility), as defined by a standard ESLint configuration (e.g., eslint-config-airbnb or eslint-config-standard).
- **FR-004**: The system MUST NOT change the project's behavior, as verified by existing tests.
- **FR-005**: The system MUST add documentation to undocumented code.
- **FR-006**: The system MUST remove all `//` comments.
- **FR-007**: A new script/task named `coverage` MUST be added to `package.json` to calculate code coverage.
- **FR-008**: A new GitHub workflow MUST be created to trigger the code coverage task automatically.
- **FR-009**: The system MUST review existing JSDoc comments and update them if they no longer match the function's behavior.
