# Implementation Plan: Code Quality Improvements

**Branch**: `004-code-quality-improvements` | **Date**: 2025-09-22 | **Spec**: [link](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/003-code-quality-improvements/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI, `QWEN.md` for Qwen Code or `AGENTS.md` for opencode).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

## Summary
The feature focuses on a comprehensive review and refactoring of the existing codebase. The goal is to improve code quality, maintainability, and adherence to best practices without altering the current behavior. This will be achieved by identifying and removing duplicate, unused, and "nonsense" code, adding documentation, and integrating code coverage reporting.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: Node.js >=18
**Primary Dependencies**: `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`, `eslint`
**Storage**: N/A
**Testing**: `node --test`
**Target Platform**: Node.js CLI
**Project Type**: Single project.
**Performance Goals**: N/A
**Constraints**: Must not alter existing behavior as validated by current tests.
**Scale/Scope**: Entire repository codebase.

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- **I. Entrega de uma única ferramenta**: PASS. The work is a refactoring of the existing tool.
- **II. Simplicidade operacional**: PASS. No new runtime frameworks are added. Dev dependencies for linting and coverage are acceptable.
- **III. Testes como gate de qualidade**: PASS. The feature relies on existing tests and adds coverage analysis, strengthening this principle.
- **IV. Observabilidade enxuta**: PASS. No changes to logging.
- **V. Segurança e privacidade pragmáticas**: PASS. No changes to security.

**Structure Decision**: Option 1: Single project.

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
Research was conducted to clarify ambiguous terms in the feature specification. The findings are consolidated in `research.md`.

**Output**: `research.md` with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved.

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
This feature is a refactoring effort and does not introduce new data models or API contracts. Therefore, `data-model.md` and `contracts/` will not be generated. The `quickstart.md` will be updated to include instructions for the new code coverage task.

**Output**: `quickstart.md`

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Generate tasks based on the functional requirements in `spec.md`.
- Create tasks for:
  - Setting up and configuring a tool for duplicate code detection.
  - Setting up and configuring a tool for unused code detection (e.g., `depcheck` or similar).
  - Enhancing the ESLint configuration for stricter code quality checks.
  - A manual or semi-automated pass to document undocumented code.
  - A script or command to remove all `//` comments.
  - Adding a `coverage` script to `package.json`.
  - Creating a GitHub workflow for code coverage.

**Ordering Strategy**:
1.  Setup of tooling (linting, coverage, code analysis).
2.  Code analysis and documentation tasks.
3.  `package.json` and GitHub workflow updates.

**Estimated Output**: 7-10 numbered, ordered tasks in `tasks.md`.

## Complexity Tracking
No constitutional violations that require justification.
